only one file will be used for a parallel sort for two files: an input and an output file
parallelization is the name of the same, so work on correctness first

bottleneck might be the mutex lock on the reading of pages, since we dont want duplicate
reads to the same line, but parallel sort might be ok to work with in a data structure,
since if editing pointers is what is needed, the data shouldn't be corrupted if we have
multiple move (maybe not).
